      Le Grand Concours
    </a>
    is an annual competition run by the 
    <a href="http://www.frenchteachers.org/" target="_blank">
      American Association of Teachers of French
    </a>
    for students in grades K-12 who study French.
  </p>
  <p>  
    In the Eastern Massachusetts region the contest is facilitated through the 
    <a href="http://www.emassconcours.net/" target="_blank">EMass Concours
    website</a>.

    I have served as technical consultant to the administrator for this 
    region since January 2012 &mdash; fixing bugs, adding features, and 
    providing general technical advice.

    In order to show my best work on the site, I would have to provide
    administrator credentials, which is a very bad idea security-wise. This
    sample code will have to suffice.
