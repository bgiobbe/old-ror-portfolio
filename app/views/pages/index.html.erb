          <div id='why'>
            <p>After many years of software engineering, I am shifting my
              career focus to web development. Web development offers more
              scope for creativity and involves more diverse types of work and
              more professional longevity.
            </p>
            <p>In the beginning I looked for a technology stack that fit me.
              I chose open-source rather than proprietary (MS), MVC framework
              (like Rails or Django) rather than content manager (like Drupal or
              Wordpress). I planned to use subversion for source control, but
              then discovered and adopted git. Two online classes I took included
              Ruby on Rails and I picked up a consulting gig for a website written
              in Ruby on Rails, so I've chosen that for my first stack.
            </p>
            <p>  
              There are so many big and little things that you just can't get
              from coursework. To reach the professional standard I am accustomed
              to, I need to work with experienced web developers.
              <span class="hilite">What are the best practices that produce
              websites that work well and are maintainable? What's different
              about the web development lifecyle? How do you develop 
              efficiently?</span> Apprentice.io looks like exactly  what I have
              been looking for.
