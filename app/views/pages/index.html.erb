    <p>After many years of software engineering, I am shifting my
      career focus to web development. Web development offers more
      scope for creativity and involves more diverse types of work and
      more professional longevity.
    </p>
    <p>In the beginning I looked for a technology stack that fit me.
      I chose open-source rather than proprietary (MS), MVC framework
      (like Rails or Django) rather than content manager (like Drupal or
      Wordpress). I planned to use subversion for source control, but
      then discovered and adopted git. Two online classes I took included
      Ruby on Rails and I picked up a consulting gig for a website written
      in Ruby on Rails, so I've chosen that for my first stack.
    </p>
    <p>This website is intended to show a little bit of what I can do and
      who I am.
