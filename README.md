Hi! I am a senior software engineer who is transitioning to the web.
This repository contains my portfolio to show a little bit of what I can do and who I am.
You can view it at [http://bgiobbe.herokuapp.com/](http://bgiobbe.herokuapp.com/).

If you need a Ruby-on-Rails person in the Boston MetroWest area, please consider me ;)
